    pc: `This is my PC. These days, I primarily work in JavaScript/TypeScript. I've completed several projects using these languages and also have a fondness for PHP. Over the last 6 years, I've honed my skills as a FullStack Developer, with a focus on frontend (70%) and backend (30%) development. Regardless of the language, I simply enjoy programming.`,

    'cs-degree': `This is my CS degree. I hung it on the wall because I'm proud of it. It was a very theoretical degree but I think it gave me a good foundation.`,

    'sofa-table': `That's my sofa. I like to relax here and watch YouTube. I'm eager to launch my programming blog, and I'm putting in every effort to get the ball rolling.`,

    tv: `This is my TV. I follow tech YouTubers who enjoy thinking outside the box regarding development and creating something new. I can share links and discuss them if you want.😊`,

    bed: `It's not just a bed; it's where inspiration meets comfort, nurturing my passion for innovation and shaping my dreams into reality.`,

    resume: `This is my CV. I am very proud of my experiences and the projects I've worked on. Please <a href="https://t.rumiantcev.com" target="_blank">contact me</a>, and I will send it to you.`,

    projects: `I specialize as a Frontend Developer, deeply committed to crafting Single Page Applications (SPAs) with React and developing mobile apps using React Native. 
    Additionally, I excel in the dynamic realm of 3D computer graphics and web animation, employing tools such as Three.js, GreenSock, Kaboom.js to realize imaginative concepts.
    By the way, this portfolio is made with the Kaboom.js. Text is rendered with HTML/CSS. So the textbox you're currently reading is not rendered within canvas.

    library: `There are a lot of programming books on my shelves. Programming isn't the only thing that motivates me. Fiction also holds a significant place on my bookshelf. Could you suggest something thought-provoking for me to read?`,
